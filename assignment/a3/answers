# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# | Section (2): Classification with a fine tuned BERT model (22 points)  | 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Question 2.1 (/5): How many trainable parameters are in your dense hidden layer?
multiclass_text_classification_2_2_1: 
- your answer

# Question 2.2 (/5): How many trainable parameters are in your classification layer?
multiclass_text_classification_2_2_2: 
- your answer

# Question 2.3 (/5): What is the Test accuracy score you get from your model with a batch size of 8?
multiclass_text_classification_2_2_3: 
- your answer

# Question 2.4 (/2): What is the key difference between the macro average F1 score and the weighted average F1 score?
# (This question is multiple choice.  Delete all but the correct answer).
multiclass_text_classification_2_2_4: 
 - No difference, they are essentially the same
 - The weighted average accounts for imbalance in the labels
 - The macro average is a surrogate for precision only

# Question 2.5 (/5): What is the macro average F1 score you get from the classification report for batch size 8?
multiclass_text_classification_2_2_5: 
- your answer


# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# | Section (3): Classification with some preprocessed data and the BERT model (28 points)  | 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Question 3.1 (/5): What is the test accuracy you get when you run the new first stage model with only 19 classes?
multiclass_text_classification_3_3_1: 
- your answer

# Question 3.2 (/5): What is the F1 score you get for the combined class when you run the new first stage model with only 19 classes?
multiclass_text_classification_3_3_2: 
- your answer

# Question 3.3 (/5): What is the macro average F1 score you get when you run the new second stage model with only 2 classes?
multiclass_text_classification_3_3_3: 
- your answer

# Question 3.4 (/5): What is the macro average F1 score you get from the combined two-step model?
multiclass_text_classification_3_3_4: 
- your answer

# Question 3.5 (/2): What is the difference in points between the macro weighted F1 score for the original model and the combined two-step model?
multiclass_text_classification_3_3_5: 
- your answer

# Question 3.6 (/2): What is the new F1 score for the last category (i.e. label_to_replace, the one that had the lowest F1 score in the original model)?
multiclass_text_classification_3_3_6: 
- your answer

# Question 3.7 (/2): What is the new F1 score for the other category that you combined with the last category in the two-step model (i.e. label_to_replace_with)?
multiclass_text_classification_3_3_7: 
- your answer

# Question 3.8 (/2): Which metric (precision or recall) is now lower for the other category (i.e. label_to_replace_with)?
# (This question is multiple choice.  Delete all but the correct answer).
multiclass_text_classification_3_3_8: 
 - Precision is lower
 - Recall is lower
 - They're equal


# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# | Section (4): Examine some misclassified examples (4 points)  | 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Question 4.1 (/2): Why do you think the two-step model got these examples wrong, when the original model got them right?
# (This question is multiple choice.  Delete all but the correct answer).
multiclass_text_classification_4_4_1: 
 - A. The two-step model saw less examples of the "label_to_replace" class
 - B. In the two-step process, the step 1 model overpredicted the combined class
 - C. It's probably just random...

# Question 4.2 (/2): Is there anything you might try next, to try to make the two-step model better?
# (This question is multiple choice.  Delete all but the correct answer).
multiclass_text_classification_4_4_2: 
 - A. Try to balance the training data across classes at each step, or add class weights when calling model.fit.
 - B. Try to combine another similar category with the two easily confused ones, for a step 1 model with 18 classes and the step 2 model with 3 classes.
 - C. Try both A and B
