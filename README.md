# DATASCI 266: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

Understanding language is fundamental to human interaction. Our brains have
evolved language-specific circuitry that helps us learn it very quickly;
however, this also means that we have great difficulty explaining how exactly
meaning arises from sounds and symbols. This course is a broad introduction
to linguistic phenomena and our attempts to analyze them with machine learning.
We will cover a wide range of concepts with a focus on practical applications
such as text classification, information extraction, machine translation, language generation, question answering, and summarization.
