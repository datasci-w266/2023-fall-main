        "## Fine-tuning a Seq2Seq model (T5) in Colab with limited RAM, PyTorch version\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is an extension of the notebook [Training NLP models in Colab without running out of RAM](https://github.com/datasci-w266/2023-fall-main/blob/master/materials/walkthrough_notebooks/keras_with_limited_ram/keras_training_with_limited_ram.ipynb). This series focuses on how to avoid running out of memory by loading part of your data at a time while you train, and saving model checkpoints as you go. We recommend reading that earlier notebook first, which has more complete explanations of these techniques shown, but for fine-tuning a BERT model.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook focuses on sequence-to-sequence (encoder-decoder, text generation) models like T5, because the way you fine-tune the Huggingface pretrained versions of those models is a little different than BERT. With T5, you use the full pre-trained model end-to-end without adding any additional layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some Huggingface models are only available in pytorch versions. The way you fine-tune those is a little different from using keras with tensorflow models. But Huggingface provides a trainer class that is pretty easy to use, and can work with an iterator somewhat like the data generator used in the first notebook (to avoid loading all your data at once).\n",
        "\n",
        "(If you're using a tensorflow model, we have a [separate notebook for fine-tuning a pretrained tensorflow T5 model](https://github.com/datasci-w266/2023-fall-main/blob/master/materials/walkthrough_notebooks/keras_with_limited_ram/fine_tune_t5_with_limited_ram_keras.ipynb).)\n",

The preprocessor and data iterator need to be defined slightly differently from the data generator used in the previous notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the preprocessor, the pytorch models want the inputs in a dictionary with keys for 'input_ids', 'attention_mask', and 'labels'. The first two are the inputs to the encoder (the original text), and the labels are the translated text vocab ids. Since we're passing this all into a trainer, we don't need to separate out the decoder input_ids. The trainer will infer those from the labels (offset by one).\n",
        "\n",
        "For the input data, the trainer will index an item from our iterator for one example at a time (not a whole batch). So the preprocessing function needs to return a one-dimensional vector of input_ids for each example, not a two dimensional batch. (The trainer will put them together into a batch to pass into the model.)\n",
        "\n",
        "This process would get very slow if we call pandas.read_csv once for every single example (row of data), though. So we'll add a function to the iterator to pre-load larger chunks of data (but not too large to run out of memory), and then return one example each time the get-item method is called. (The first notebook in this series explains why we're using pandas, which has a handy function for specifying only certain rows of a csv to skip vs load. Pandas isn't the fastest IO method, but others get more complicated, so replace it if you're comfortable using something else.)"
