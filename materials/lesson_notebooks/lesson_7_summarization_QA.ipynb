        "One of the challenges faced by current neural systems is the size of the input they can manage.  As a result most  of these systems end up truncating the input in some fashion.  Can you get a good summary if you only read in the first 500 words of a document?  One solution to this is to use an older approach called extractive summarization.  In this approach the content of the input document(s) is broken into sentences which are scored for their relevance to either the document or to a query.  We'll demonstrate it's use on a wikipedia article.\n",

It's a very straightforward approach using probabilities to assign scores to each sentence and word and then pick the highest scoring sentences.  Those highest scoring sentences are extracted from the original and then printed as part of the summary.  The original paper (MSR-TR-2005-101) can be [found here](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elhadad/nlp09/sumbasic.pdf) as well as a [followup article by the same authors here](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~nenkova/papers/ipm.pdf).
