It comes with a number of different language models trained on the [OntoNotes5](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19) data set.  This means that it is already trained to do part of speech tagging and dependency parsing.  It can also be trained to do classification and a number of other tasks in the standard NLP stack.  It is very fast.  It can be a handy way of analyzing some text for exploratory data analysis. Another use is annotating some text to then create a labelled training set that you use to train up your own model independent of spaCy.\n",
